# Insertion-Sort
Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that places an unsorted element at its suitable place in each iteration. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Basically, Insertion sort is efficient for small data values Insertion sort is adaptive in nature, i.e. it is appropriate for data sets which are already partially sorted.

Algorithm

Step 1 - If the element is the first element, assume that it is already sorted. Return 1.

Step2 - Pick the next element, and store it separately in a key.

Step3 - Now, compare the key with all elements in the sorted array.

Step 4 - If the element in the sorted array is smaller than the current element, then move to the next element. Else, shift greater elements in the array towards the right.

Step 5 - Insert the value.

Step 6 - Repeat until the array is sorted.
